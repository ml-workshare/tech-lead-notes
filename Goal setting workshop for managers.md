Learning about goals.
assumes peple already know what to do. What do we do? How do we help define goals-- soln: workshops.

Generate as many ideas as possible
Get a sense of which things, go wide rather than deep. Choose which are most important, then fine tune, and make them more achievable.

format of workshop: how much prep do you need? Have more time and space to reflect.

Provide enough time & space to reflect.

# VALUES
who are they? how do they do thigns? 
<discuss results form perosnality tets/quizzes>

where do you get your energy from? what is your pupose? passion? motivation? how would you describe ourself in 5 words? what building blocks that make up "you"?


# Future
what impact do you want to make on the world? what are your life goals?
what their ideal life and career would be?

come up with anit goals-- what don't you want to happen?

what do you want to have achived by retirment?
what do you wan tot be in 5? 10?

day/to/day questions
what does work-life balance look likef or you?
what does your ideal day look like?

doesn't have to just be about work stuff. stuff like exercise/meditaiton...

eg. never want to work overtime
eg. dont ever want to be bored?

# CURRRNT
how's it going? 

- challengses of the role?
- abilities/interets/values are you able to do in your role? what do you want more of? what would you miss?

what kinds of peope do you most enjoy workign with? what work environments do you enjoy most?

(use a job description and or career development framewokr -- beg borrow steal from other companies.)

# CURRENT SKILLS
what are your strngths? what are your weeknesses?

- what do you do better htan others? what do others see as your strgenths?
- gaps in knwoledge and or experiences?
- what tecnnical skills can you develope?
what communication skills can you develop?
what leadership skills can you develope?


if peple are drawn to speciific areas in quesitons-- point isn't to have answers for everything, but rather as aset of prompts for conversations.

once we have these we can jump to goals. Relaly reflect and think about what they want to do.

You dont' have to know where you're goingt o be in 5 years, just where you are next?

call to action: stop, think about...

whats next for you, your team, and how to get there.
