How to unblock teams to continusously deliver @ Spotify

"Flow" in lean means kanban/scrum board - throughput of tasks
backlog -> done

finding bottlenecks

problems: lots of WIP, things werent moving into done fast due to bottlenecks

- introduced WIP limits 
 -- incresed flow, but added friction because review had to happen (bottleneck)
 -- introduced TDD & DDD 
    -- session son how to do test first, big architecutal discussions. 
       (DDD bounded context)
- pairing / mobbing as default
    -- flow was increased, but high degreee of friction. wasn't fun.

<<
 key takeaway: introduction of agile / archictectual techniques helped with flow but increased
 developer friction as bottlenecks appeared.

 friction / bad things decresed after adding "soft"? 
 
>>


(bad thigns; stress, anxiety, conflict)

Blockers of flow:
I can't brainstorm cause I haven't had time to think on my own first.
practice
 - get the talking going without bothering about being right all the time. See project Aristotle (google) psychological safety. 
   - "code" creme brulee
    set out to crash that surface once per person per week at least.
    - ask stupid questions
    - interject, be vulerable
   - training: "toxic" communicatoins - 4 patterns to avoid. 
       Critisism, defensivness, contempt, stonewalling.
       Antidotes: introudced the I message - "I think this sucks" vs "this sucks"
       Contempt needs to stop, antidote is appreciation.
       "Yes and.." from improv
       "Wait your turn"

We think so differently, it's just better we don't pairt together...
practice: friendly feedback. Non violaent communication format - transparency model. Marshall Rosenberg.

1.express observation.

WHen <something happened> I felt <share feeling> because I have a need for < need>. Would you consider < foo> ?

"Turn up the good"
We're more likely to imrpove our ways of working if we focus on what we're doing great and imporve on that, rather than focusing on finding faults.

retro fromat: just focus on stuff that IS workign. Decide 1 acition on things that are working well to ramp it up.

"I'm not sure about the purpose of this team, or what I'm doing here?"

answer why: OKRS (Objective key results)

Objectives originally were solution driven at the beginning, not top down or inspirational. Everoyrone should be able to get behidng them and understand them. "eg. Centralise all CI at spotify". KRs are measurements of how far along on the objective.

KR - increase customer base by 60%

The HOW is left up to the team.


"Dispicable design" - why do we exist as a team from our user's perspective.
Define the worst possible user design. How do we make things worse?
- then categorise
- then improve each of these areas.
