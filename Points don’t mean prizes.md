Points donâ€™t mean prizes

uneven flow due to different sotry sizes 

so then we must estimate stories? if story is > foo, then it gets broken down etc etc.

people dont care about stories, they care about value. actual value of smalller stories is not delivered in a regular fashion. we lose track of the value as stories are split down.

three questions that can help:

1. can the story be deferred?
2. can we thin it? deliver less but still deliver the underlying value to customers. Build the 20% that gives 80% of the value.
3. can it be split that ALL supply value to customer?

stories should provide incremental value to customer.
we still get smaller stories, but each story delivers value.

It's a lie: Engineers dont get to make decisions about customer value. Or team does not understand over arching role.

Teams need to understand context and need autonomy to understand change.

Get everyone understanding conext and autonomy to do stuff together.
