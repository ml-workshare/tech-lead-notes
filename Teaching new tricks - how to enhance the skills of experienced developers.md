Strategies for teaching ksill sot menotr your team

1. Pairing

2. Workshops
deliver something. doesn't have to be pro. 
eg async await
- intro the usbject
- devise example with sample
- split into peairs, timeox to 30 minutes, 
what did we learn, where did we stuck on. repeat.
- sample code from code base to help work it out

the more questions/ scafoold we have, the better. but as a team, have a culture we're all learning together.

exploring as a group. group learning.
just steal someone elses' workshop lols,

3. Group learning

find a tutorial, work through it toghter. DO it ias a "mob".

Don't overload the team.

don't give a learning deadline. consolidate learning, get people to teach each other to get people at the same pace?

4. Learn by teaching

5. Lunch & Learns
at a regular cadence. have someone do a talk/workshop at regular intervals. they don't have to be work related. Silos. Helps to foster a culture of learnign.

6. Ask loads of questions.

7. Mob programming?
useful for starting a new feature, or doing a handover. 
everyone gets it, everyone understands it all.
qa / ba in the room to provide inline feedback. a great way of knowledge sharing and/or teaching.

8. Deep dive
Don't praise the knowledge, praise the thirst for knowledge.
Provided critical feedback, but also targeted praise.

9. Safety & Security
It's ok to be yourselves.

10. Highlight good examples
TDD, unit tests...

11. Regular retros, let the team take ownership. Feedback.
Tell people what they are doing right.
