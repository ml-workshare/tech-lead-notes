Systems that can multiply effort

"I don't have enough time"

there's a podcast

there's a website

Talk outline:
1. Communication
- being undestood by larger, lager groups, and messaging being retold (chinese whispers). 
- manager readme: 

know and manage exectations, know how to communicate.

personal brandingself promotion: someone has to notice your performance

what can you do? speak up - email what we do. take pride and praise other people. Have confidence.

"Power poses" - imitate a gorilla, lols. 

Overconfidence vs falsely confident. Get honest feedback. Master the ability to get and give feedback. Work proactively to improve these things. Feedback seeking behaviour.

Provide a safe environemnt where people can say antyhing, consequence free. Get feedback always, on specific questions. 

Resource: Google manager feedback survey. 

How to say no, without feeling guilty inside.

2. Prioritise and Time Management

Time perception is different to different people. Estimations and manaagement is terrible, require systems to assist in success. 

168 hours / 40 work / 8 sleep / 5 => 67 hours everything else.

step 1. get data. Create a list of things that need to be done. (see GTD book)
 - dark matter tasks, lots of small things that aren't accounted ofr during planning. caused by "hey, quick favour?"
time audit: journal all interruptsions, quick favous, things that happen....

with our list, perform prioritization. 

"which one of these is the most important?"

eisenouwer materix
(go get the chart, it's a quadrant) -- 

"get better at doing fewer things"

"Multitasking is a scalilng antipattern"

Quality = intensity off focux * time spent on task.

when your'e in the zone, you lose perception of time. engineered by calendar blocking/time boxing. Organise day based on energy cycles etc. 

Alocate time in the future to do stuff...


obstacles:
- Meetings.
- delete all recurring calendar events.

email:
default state of email should be off (including notifications). Schedule short blocks during the day to look at emails.

slack:
set DND on focus sprints. 

Obsess over things that matter.


3. Delegation

Let it go.
use a list we crated
see who can do the work based on skillset/interests
give them a plan with expectations


hire to balance out weaknesses.
"delegating decisions"


4. Personal Development & mental health
- start taking care of yourself first. it gets lonely.
- find ssupport gorup, peer group.

Make yourself a priority -- exerise. yeah.
