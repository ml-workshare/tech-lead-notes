Agile techniques for elad develoeprs!

Scenarios: 
The first 1:1.

Let's discuss what we should expect from each other.

A joint working agreement 
- how you talk abotu how you approach management
- chance to discuss what the resposnbilities of hte role are as you both see them.

Brainstorm a join working agreement - process.

2 colours of postit knotes. One colour for expectations upon the lead, one colour of expections of develoepr. 10-15 minutes, until you cant think of nay more.

Take turns, place pos its, discuss what it means to you?
- does it make sense?
- Do we agree?
- Do we disagree? 

This becomes a personalised job descriptoin, physical, and visible thing. 
Capture the output
Revisit periodically (six moths or a year from now)

Over time, epxectations will chagne because we both get better at our jobs. You get more expectatoins.

Scenario:
Mentoring a future lead

The importance of teaching other people your job.

First- discuss what we both think the the responsibilities of a lead at our company? 10-15 minutes until you can't think of anymore

colums
1. these responsiblities i will keep
2. these are responsibilitites i am going toa ssign to you, but this is new for you, so you need to need to make a plan and i will approve / provide feedback on this plan.
3. thease are the responsiblities i expect yout o do, just tell me that hteyr'e done. go do them.
4. these are responsiblities that are now yours.

pick a post it
what do i think this means?
Are you ready to take this on?
What do you need to learn to do this?
How can I help yout o be ready to do this?

place the post its in each column.

Capture the output, and revisit every six moths.

# Scenario: Getting someone to talk in 1:1s

you can get stuck here.

techniques: take a walk - guarantees 1:1s take a while. it's a 15 minute walk.
takl about crap, then we'll slide into work. 

techniques: toys - we're not staring at each other and it takes the pressure off a bit.

techniques: shut up -- wait them out. give htem to choose their words & form their thoughts.

# Scenario: Making a decision in a team meeting

technique: polling
(i want your opinion, but i am the decision maker) -- gives them consequence free thinking/ideas. Imposter syndrome, belonging bias.
take temperature on something...

technique: voting
bigger responsibility -- critical that you support and defend the groups decision

be very clear wha you are doing, before they give their opinion

Polling:
Fist to five 
-- fist -- i hate this
-- 5 fingers -- i love.

you have ar ange (on three, give this idea)

Voting: 
Roman voting (thumbs up, thumbs down)

We're goint to cover our eyes. "psychological safety"

# Scenario: Collaborative Team meeting agenda
-- agendaless meetings are disrespectful
- a shared docuemtn captures the agenda and minutes. everyone in the meeting adds their items (and estimate time requred) to the shared document beofre the meeting. 

peple can add items before the meeting. You have to get it in before 

<Lean COffee> run the meeting.
everyone nominates the topic
votes on the topics - 

facillator sets a timer
sets a timer
person who prosed topic leads the discussion
roman vote? keep talking? yes? no?

# Scenario: More inclusive team meetings

1. Shut up, your authority will encourage peple to confirm.
chose how you enter the converation.

2. Set expectations, and be clear on the impact of the meeting. Are we making a decision or just talking?

3. Observer's roleiin the meeting
- watch peple interrupting
- watching people repeating ideas without giving cvredit
- certain people speaking too much

- passive observer writes notes.
- active observer -- the will apply corrective action.

rotate roles (note taker, facilitator, observer).

4. publish the agenda to let people prepre mentally and emotionally

# A parting thought
You set the tone and conduct for your team based on your actions and how you react to others.
