# Notes: Go Slow to Go Fast - @aliciatweet

As a developer, we use code as a tool to solve problems. As a tech lead, your team is the tool.

## As an individual:
- You can't be an effective leader without the right foundations. Otherwise you'll burn out.
- Developer skills that have worked so well as a developer do not work well in people management. 
- Embrace discomfort

## As a team lead
- The tech lead role isn't to lead; it's to provide an environment for a individusals to thrive. 

### Useful techinques
- Managing anxiety - schedule time to worry. Then realise that if you have time to worry, you have time to plan for it.
- Listen
- Practice Mindfulness
- Embrace and seek feedback.
