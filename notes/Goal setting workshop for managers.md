# Notes: Goal setting workshop for managers - @mseckington

## Defining goals:

1. Generate as many ideas as possible. Go wide, rather than deep.
2. Choose which are most important.
3. Fine tune; make them more achieveable.

Workshops are better with prep, but the important thing is to do them. You should, however, provide enough time and space to reflect.

| VALUES (ideal/instrinsic) | FUTURUE (ideal/extrinsic) |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| CURRENT SKILLS (intrinsic/now) | CURRENT ROLE (extrinsic/now)

4. Discuss. Use the questions below as a prompt for discussion. You don't *have* to have answers for everything.

5. After they've had a think, set goals. What's next for you? Your team? How do you get there?
