# Notes: Points donâ€™t mean prizes - @adrianh

Key takeway: "talk about delivered value, instead of story points"

- The practice of splitting epics into smaller stories often leaves customer value delivered in untimely fashion.
- As stories/epics are divided into smaller and uniform sizes, the actual value can be lost.

Key questions:
1. Can we defer the story?
2. Can we thin it? 
- deliver less, but still deliver the underlying value to customers. Build the 20% that gives 80% of the value.
3. Can the story be split so that all stories deliver value? 
- each story should provide incremental value.

How to answer these questions?
- Teams need to understand business context and have the autonomy to execute the change.
- OKRs
- Turn assumptions into hypothesis before build, build experiments to build them.
