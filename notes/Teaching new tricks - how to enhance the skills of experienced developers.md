# Notes - Teaching New Tricks â€“ How to enhance the skills of experienced developers - @claresudbery

We are all teachers

## Principles
1. No Elitism

2. Empathy. Imagine what it feels like to be them.

3. Diversity
Strive for diverse teams bcause teams perform better with different perspectives.

## Strategies for teaching skills/mentor your team

1. Pairing

2. Workshops
Just deliver something. Doesn't have to be professional/perfect. eg. a workshop about C# async await

### Format:
- intro the subject
- devise example with sample code.
- split into pairs, timebox to 30 minutes.
- Stop. Ask what did we learn, where did we stuck on. 
- Repeat.
- Take sample code from the code base to see how lessons learned can be applied.

The more preparation there is, and the more "scaffold" around the workshop there is, the better. But the idea is, as a team, we have a culture that we're all learning together. Look for other scaffolds/workshops to borrow.

3. Group Learning

- Find a tutorial, work through it toghter. DO it as a "mob".
- Don't overload the team.
- Don't give a learning deadline. 
- Consolidate learning, if people learn at faster paces, then get the faster people to teach the others so the group can move together. 

4. Learn by teaching. Volunteer for codebar.

5. Lunch & Learns: at a regular cadence, have someone do a talk/workshop on a topic. They don't have to be work related, but it helps foster a culture of learning.

6. Ask loads of questions (as a tech lead). Be visibily curious.

7. Mob programming.
- Useful for starting a new feature, or for doing a handover. 
- everyone gets it, everyone understands it all at the same time.
- Have QA / BA in the room to provide inline feedback.
- A great way of knowledge sharing and/or teaching.

8. Deep dive. Don't praise the knowledge, praise the thirst for knowledge. Provided critical feedback, but also provide targeted praise.

9. Provie Safety & Security. It's ok to be yourselves.

10. Highlight good examples. TDD, unit tests...

11. Regular retros, let the team take ownership. Feedback.
Tell people what they are doing right.

12. Be open to change.

13. Learning should be fun.
