# Notes: The Hardest Scaling Challenge of All - Yourself - @cmccarrick

## 1. Communication
Your message has to be communicated to and understood 
- by larger & larger groups.
- by people above you (managers), across from you (peers), below you (teams)
- by second hand people. It must survive being retold.

Techniques:
- The manager readme declares a message, sets expectations

"In order for your good performance to have any effect on your career, somebody needs to notice your good performance."

- know and manage exectations, know how to communicate.
- personal branding, self promotion: someone has to notice your performance
- speak up - email what we do. take pride and praise other people. Have confidence.
- "Power poses" - imitate a gorilla, lols. 
- Caution: Overconfidence ok, but falsely confident is bad.

 Get honest feedback. Master the ability to get and give feedback. Work proactively to improve these things. Encourage feedback seeking behaviour.

eg. The Google Manager feedback survey

- Learn how to say no, without feeling guilty inside.

## 2. Prioritization & Time Management

Key points:
1. Get better at doing fewer things.
2. Multiasking is a scaling anti-pattern.
3. *Obsess over things that matter.*
4. Quality = Intensity of focus * Time spent on task. 

Aim to be in the "zone" where you lose perception of time.

Techniques:

1. Get data 
- List things that need doing (see GTD)
- Be aware of dark matter tasks; tasks that aren't accounted for during planning. "Hey -- quick favour?"
- Journal all interruptions, favours, things that just happen.

2. Prioritise items (see Eisenhower matrix)


| Important & Urgent (DO) | Important & Non-Urgent (PLAN) |
| ----------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| Unimportant & Urgent (DELEGATE) | Unimportant & Not Urgent (ELIMINATE) |

3. Calendar Blocking

Allocate time to do "stuff".

### Obstacles:

- Meetings. Delete all recurring calendar events.
- Email. Default state of emails & notifications should be off. Schedule short blocks during the day to review emails.
- Slack. Set DND on focus sprints.

## 3. Delegation

Key points:
1. Learn to let it go.

Techniques.
1. Review list created above, identify
- skillsets & interests required
- identify who can do the work
- develope a plan with expectations

Hire out to balance out weaknesses.

## 4. Personal Development

- start by taking care of yourself first.
- It gets lonely, find a support group/per group.
- Make yourself a priority. Exercise.

Consider

- Mentors / coaches / trainers
- Meditation. See headspace app.
- Read every day.
