# Notes: Using Agile Techniques to Build a More inclusive Team - @kevingoldsmith

You set the tone and conduct for your team based on your actions and how you react to others.

Here are some techniques to handle team scenarios.

## Scenario: The first 1:1
An opportunity to establish a working agreement. "Let's discuss what we should expect from each other".

- discuss how you approach management
- discuss responsibilities of the role as both lead and dev see them.

### Process:
1. 10-15 minutes -- Each person creates a post-it for each expectation of the lead and the dev. 
2. Two categories: Lead, and Dev. Discuss and place each post-it: Does it make sense? Do we agree?

This becomes a personalised job description. 

3. Capture and revisit every 6 months. Expectation will increase as we get better at or jobs.


## Scenario: Mentoring a future lead
### Process: 

1. 10-15 minutes -- Each person creates a post-it for each responsibility of a lead at our company.

2. Discuss each post it:

- What do I think this means?
- Are you ready to take this on?
- What do you need to learn to do this?
- How can I help you to be ready to do this?

3. Place post-its in a matrix as follows:

| Retained Responsibilities | Assigned and Reviewed | Assigned and Notified | Assigned responsibility |
| ------------------------- | --------------------- | --------------------- | ----------------------- |
| These responsibiliities will be kept by you | I will assign these responsibilities to you, but this is new for you, so make a plan that I will approve / provide feedback on | I expect you to do these, just tell me when they're done | These responsibilities are now yours.

4. Capture and revisit every in 6 months. Responsibilities will go from right to left.

## Scenario: Getting someone to talk in 1:1s

Techniques:

- Take a walk - guarantees 1:1s take a while. it's a 15 minute walk. Talk about whatever, it'll slide into work.

- Toys - we're not staring at each other and it takes the pressure off a bit.

- Shut up -- wait them out. Give them time to choose their words & form their thoughts.

## Scenario: Making a decision in a team meeting

Two techniques: Polling, Voting. Be very clear which one is going to happen before they give their opinion.

Polling: Be the decision maker -- allows consequence free thinking/ideas. "Fist to five" - on a 3 count, form a fist to say I hate this, 5 fingers to say I love this, any number of fingers in between. 

Voting: You go with the group consensus; criticial that you support and defend the group's decision. Roman voting -- thumbs up, thumbs down.

You can make voting anonymous for psychological safety.

## Scenario: Collaborative Team Meetings
- Provide an agenda as a shared document that captures the agenda and minutes. 
- Everyone adds their items and time estimate required to the document.
- At the start of the meeting, vote on the items to discuss. 
- Set a timer. Person who proposes the topic leads the discussion. At timer expiry, roman vote to continue discussion.


## Scenario: More inclusive team meetings

1. Shut up, your authority will encourage people to confirm.
Chose how you enter the converation.

2. Set expectations, and be clear on the impact of the meeting. Are we making a decision or just talking?

3. Observer's role in the meeting
- watch people interrupting
- watching people repeating ideas without giving credit
- certain people speaking too much

- passive observer writes notes.
- active observer -- the will apply corrective action.
- rotate roles (note taker, facilitator, observer).

4. publish the agenda to let people prepare mentally and emotionally
