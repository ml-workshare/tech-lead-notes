1. everyone in a meeting is a talking head.
allows an equal participation environment.

2. push conversations out into the public where people can monitor and potentilally help out.

you have to be very explicit about how to work in a distributed team. 
Psychologial safety
https://rework.withgoogle.com/blog/fie-keys-to-a-succssful-google-team/

biggest indicator: is the team feelign psycholigally safe.

starts with getting peole together physically.
this has to happen with regular cadence. it has to be "normal". 
plan, and use the time together well. be explicit about how the time together will be used - 

example -- look at the long term strategy.
example -- team structure? examine wether team structure fits?
example -- iterate on a collaboration process.

don't do day to day development. it's an artificial way to do it. it dosen't work.

definately do non work activities. have dinner?
build socical capital.
eg. volunteering (code schoool)?
eg. cooking together?

do your own lighting talks. (5 minutes, anything)


distributedly:
keep talking, continue to build trust in 1:1s, do it regularly.

non work video chats: not every meeting has to be a meeting :) just hang out using the vidoe confrencing tool.

virtual water cooler.

definately be aware of the time zones. But dont' screw up the minority for the majority. Share the burden as a team.

# Asynchronous communication
- 12 hour time differences suck, lets do a meeting but lets plan this. 
- DRY is a bad technique for a manager.

public vs private message metric.

# status updates
is it useful? meetings are used as a crutch. do we need to force people to share informatoin and do these things asynchornously.

No instant gratification -- if you have a question, no immediate answer, 1WD. Bare minimum amount of time to expect an answer. 

Work on unblocking people due to time zone issues. 
Don't block yourself -- you can't just sit there, have independent tasks you can switch to.

Over-communicate. Repeat. 

Use restraint. Feedback? wait.

Don't work in the evening. Hardly anythign is urgent.

# use timezone spread
it can be used to your advantage. we can hand it off to different timezones.

EVERYONE IS DISTRIBUTED
WORK HARD ON BULDING TEAM BODNDS
ENABLE ASYNC WORKFLOWS
USE THE POWER OF DISTRIBUTED TEAMS.
