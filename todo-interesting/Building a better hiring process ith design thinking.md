designing a process that would improve over time.
- focus on value propsoitio of opportunity that we offer to candidate specific to their ggrowth goals.

goals:

1. cut bias (improve diversity)
2. set expectations, (increase delight)
3. get to yes (improve yield rate)

methods:

interviews, journey mapping, paper prototyping
made more interactive throgh experiential learning.

allowing new hires to practice the ux design process on a design challenge.

1. research
pair people up, timebox an activity. (eg 5-7 minutes).
coach people to ask open-ended quesitons. ask questions in a more neutral way, eg. describe what happened. as they describe, what did you think? how did ou feel?

2. map the experience.
for each phase, map the touch points (digital, personal). who did people interat with.

people
touchpoints
emotions

3. prototype & test
help ideas to come to life quickly?
pens/paper, paper
timenox the activity?

4. ship & iterate


quickwins:
- multiple people emailing next steps, no single voice.
- clarify the roles of people in interview process

backstage
 - eg. indiate who gets what information going into interivew


every interview kept asking me the smae questions over and over again.
people weren't listening to each other / alignment.

- fix: create resources. an interviewer guide for every stage of the interview process. here's where YOU fit into the process.

- an agenda for each type of interivew
- recommended steps for each
- characteristics to assess the person on.
- note template to help to collection information. these notes woudl be reivewed by other poelp to cut bias. perception / bias creeps in, a cnadidate takes  ahile to get to the point... can be perceived as nervousness, or they're not a good communicator. Noe taking template structured in a way -- write exaclty what was being said. second perosn would map out what the interview'rs conclusion was.
