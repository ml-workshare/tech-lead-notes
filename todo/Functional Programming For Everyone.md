no mutuables. no loops.

# immutability island:
rule: there is no mutale staet, functions have no side effects.

eg instead of editing a instance of an oject, return a new instance of the object.
no talking to the outside world.
no hidden inputs.
no surprises.

wins: Easier to reason, test, parallelise.

# declarative desert
say what, not how

soup = boiled( chopped ( peeled ( tomates) ) ) + water.

instead of objects with methods.

understandible, optimisable, reusable.

designs aroudn what happen

# perspecive peak
functions are fisrt class citizens.

map, fold, recursion instead of loops.


there's a bunch of resources on the slides
