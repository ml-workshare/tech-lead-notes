SPA damages busissnesses*

why do spa for crud makes it hard to do?

spas -
easy to make
hard to make good.
extremely hard to make good, simple, fast and maintainable.

spa effort evvort/vallue - early on high value, then it gets hard (lots of waste), then lots of value.
you have to push trhogu it, but smaller product teams jsut stop.

js frameoork cycel - it's a cyclcle pattern wher eits shiny and good, then shitty. you're surfing a wave of hype.


# maximise user value whilst minimising complexity and cost

teams make apps, not tools. before big tech changes:

- product visoin -- is it clear? are we all aligned?
- do we have good coumminication poractices & psychlogical safety?
- do we have the right set of skills & capabilitites?
- are development practieces sustainable?
- do we understand what the product actually does? (documentation/test coverage). In detail?

# rewritinv encourages forgetting. rework requires learning.

rewokring a SPA is hard
- breaking them up into smaller apps?? break htem down by user journey.

elminate waste.
lots of regular smalll steps over time.

ask: what's the simplest way to sustainably grow and maintain the product 
grow the tea'ms ability to live with product
